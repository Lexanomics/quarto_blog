  abstract  = "Human T cell receptors (TCRs) are critical for mediating immune
               responses to pathogens and tumors and regulating self-antigen
               recognition. Yet, variations in the genes encoding TCRs remain
               insufficiently defined. Detailed analysis of expressed TCR
               alpha, beta, gamma, and delta genes in 45 donors from four human
               populations-African, East Asian, South Asian, and
               European-revealed 175 additional TCR variable and junctional
               alleles. Most of these contained coding changes and were present
               at widely differing frequencies in the populations, a finding
               confirmed using DNA samples from the 1000 Genomes Project.
               Importantly, we identified three Neanderthal-derived,
               introgressed TCR regions including a highly divergent TRGV4
               variant, which mediated altered butyrophilin-like molecule 3
               (BTNL3) ligand reactivity and was frequent in all modern
               Eurasian population groups. Our results demonstrate remarkable
               variation in TCR genes in both individuals and populations,
               providing a strong incentive for including allelic variation in
               studies of TCR function in human biology.",

	abstract = {The study of microorganisms is a ﬁeld of great interest due to their environmental (e.g., soil contamination) and biomedical (e.g., parasitic diseases, autism) importance. The advent of revolutionary next-generation sequencing techniques, and their application to the hypervariable regions of the 16S, 18S or 23S ribosomal subunits, have allowed the research of a large variety of organisms more in-depth, including bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and fungi. Additionally, together with the development of analysis software, the creation of speciﬁc databases (e.g., SILVA or RDP) has boosted the enormous growth of these studies. As the cost of sequencing per sample has continuously decreased, new protocols have also emerged, such as shotgun sequencing, which allows the proﬁling of all taxonomic domains in a sample. The sequencing of hypervariable regions and shotgun sequencing are technologies that enable the taxonomic classiﬁcation of microorganisms from the DNA present in microbial communities. However, they are not capable of measuring what is actively expressed. Conversely, we advocate that metatranscriptomics is a “new” technology that makes the identiﬁcation of the mRNAs of a microbial community possible, quantifying gene expression levels and active biological pathways. Furthermore, it can be also used to characterise symbiotic interactions between the host and its microbiome. In this manuscript, we examine the three technologies above, and discuss the implementation of different software and databases, which greatly impact the obtaining of reliable results. Finally, we have developed two easy-to-use pipelines leveraging Nextﬂow technology. These aim to provide everything required for an average user to perform a metagenomic analysis of marker genes with QIMME2 and a metatranscriptomic study using Kraken2/Bracken.},

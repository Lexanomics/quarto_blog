              To investigate the gut microbiota distribution and its functions in children with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). A total of 135 children were enrolled in the study, including 102 children with ARFID and 33 healthy children. Fecal samples were analyzed to explore differences in gut microbiota composition and diversity and functional differences between the ARFID and healthy control (HC) groups via 16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing. The gut microbiota composition and diversity in children with ARFID were different from those in heathy children, but there is no difference in the composition and diversity of gut microbiota between children at the age of 3–6 and 7–12 with ARFID. At the phylum level, the most abundant microbes in the two groups identified by 16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing were the same. At the genus level, the abundance of Bacteroides was higher in the ARFID group (
              P
               {\textgreater} 0.05); however, different from the result of 16SrDNA sequencing, metagenomic sequencing showed that the abundance of Bacteroides in the ARFID group was significantly higher than that in the HC group (
              P
               = 0.041). At the species level,
              Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus
              and
              Lachnospira eligens
              were the most abundant taxa in the ARFID group, and
              Prevotella copri
              ,
              Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum
              , and
              Ruminococcus gnavus
              were the top three microbial taxa in the HC group; there were no statistically significant differences between the abundance of these microbial taxa in the two groups. LefSe analysis indicated a greater abundance of the order
              Enterobacterales
              and its corresponding family
              Enterobacteriaceae,
              the family
              Bacteroidaceae
              and corresponding genus
              Bacteroides,
              the species
              Bacteroides vulgatus
              in ARFID group, while the abundance of the phylum
              Actinobacteriota
              and its corresponding class
              Actinobacteria ,
              the order
              Bifidobacteriales
              and corresponding family
              Bifidobacteriaceae
              , the genus
              Bifidobacterium
              were enriched in the HC group. There were no statistically significant differences in the Chao1, Shannon and Simpson indices between the Y1 and Y2 groups (
              P
               = 0.1,
              P
               = 0.06,
              P
               = 0.06). At the phylum level, Bacillota, Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota were the most abundant taxa in both groups, but there were no statistically significant differences among the abundance of these bacteria (
              P
               = 0.958,
              P
               = 0.456,
              P
               = 0.473,
              P
               = 0.065). At the genus level, Faecalibacterium was more abundant in the Y2 group than in the Y1 group, and the difference was statistically significant (
              P
               = 0.037). The KEGG annotation results showed no significant difference in gut microbiota function between children with ARFID and healthy children; however, GT26 was significantly enriched in children with ARFID based on the CAZy database. The most abundant antibiotic resistance genes in the ARFID group were the vanT, tetQ, adeF, ermF genes, and the abundance of macrolide resistance genes in the ARFID group was significantly higher than that in the HC group (
              P
               = 0.041). Compared with healthy children, children with ARFID have a different distribution of the gut microbiota and functional genes. This indicates that the gut microbiome might play an important role in the pathogenesis of ARFID.

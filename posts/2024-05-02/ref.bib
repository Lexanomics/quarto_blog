	abstract = {Background: Sufficient protein intake is essential for adequate physical condition and athletic performance. However, numerous factors can influence the absorption of consumed protein, includ­ ing timing, type of protein intake, and gut microbiota. In the pre­ sent study, elite male water polo players consumed a plant-based, vegan protein supplement with (n = 10) or without (n = 10) pre- and probiotics daily during the 31-day study period.},

              Although diet is a substantial determinant of the human gut microbiome, the interplay between specific foods and microbial community structure remains poorly understood. Coffee is a habitually consumed beverage with established metabolic and health benefits. We previously found that coffee is, among {\textgreater}150 items, the food showing the highest correlation with microbiome components. Here we conducted a multi-cohort, multi-omic analysis of {US} and {UK} populations with detailed dietary information from a total of 22,867 participants, which we then integrated with public data from 211 cohorts (
              N
               = 54,198). The link between coffee consumption and microbiome was highly reproducible across different populations (area under the curve of 0.89), largely driven by the presence and abundance of the species
              Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus
              . Using in vitro experiments, we show that coffee can stimulate growth of

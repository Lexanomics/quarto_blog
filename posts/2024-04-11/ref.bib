	abstract = {Objective  Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), as an emerging technique for pathogen detection, has been widely used in clinic. However, reports on the application of mNGS in cancer patients with severe pneumonia remain limited. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) mNGS in cancer patients complicated with severe pneumonia.
Methods  A total of 62 cancer patients with severe pneumonia simultaneously received culture and mNGS of BALF were enrolled in this study. We systematically analyzed the diagnostic significance of BALF mNGS. Subsequently, optimization of anti-infective therapy based on the distribution of pathogens obtained from BALF mNGS was also assessed.
Results  For bacteria and fungi, the positive detection rate of mNGS was significantly higher than culture method (91.94\% versus 51.61\%, P {\textless} 0.001), especially for poly-microbial infections (70.97\% versus 12.90\%, P {\textless} 0.001). Compared with the culture method, mNGS exhibited a diagnostic sensitivity of 100\% and a specificity of 16.67\%, with the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) being 56.14\% and 100\%, respectively. The agreement rate between these two methods was 59.68\%, whereas kappa consensus analysis indicated a poor concordance (kappa = 0.171). After receipt of BALF mNGS results, anti-infective treatment strategies in 39 out of 62 cases (62.90\%) were optimized. Moreover, anti-tumor therapy was a high-risk factor for mixed infections (87.18\% versus 65.22\%, P = 0.04).
Conclusions  The present study showed that cancer patients with severe pneumonia, especially those received anti-tumor therapy, were more likely to have poly-microbial infections. BALF mNGS can provide a rapid and},

Single-cell RNA-seq analysis is a powerful technique used in biology and medicine to study the gene expression of individual cells within a population. Single-cell gene expression analysis and bulk RNA-seq differ primarily in the scale and resolution of the analysis. Single-cell gene expression analysis focuses on individual cells, providing insights into cellular heterogeneity and rare cell populations. In contrast, bulk RNA-seq measures the average gene expression of a population of cells, masking cellular diversity. Single-cell analysis requires specialized methods to isolate and analyze individual cells, while bulk RNA-seq is more straightforward and commonly used for analyzing gene expression in larger cell populations.
 
Besides producing beautiful visualizations [@LaManno2021], single-cell data has revolutionized the information regarding cell biology, with direct applications to the understanding of cell development and human diseases.

Hereâ€™s some use cases for single-cell data:

- **Cellular Heterogeneity** ðŸ§¬: Understand the complex biological processes such as development, disease progression, and immune responses.

- **Developmental Biology** ðŸŒ±: Insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cell differentiation and development.

- **Cancer Research** ðŸ¦ : Study tumor heterogeneity, identify rare subpopulations of cells, and track the evolution of cancer cells over time or in response to treatment.

- **Neuroscience** ðŸ§ : Map the cellular diversity of the brain, identify different cell types, and understand how they function in both healthy and diseased states.

- **Immunology** ðŸ¦ : Study immune cell diversity, activation states, and responses to stimuli.

- **Stem Cell Biology** ðŸŒ±: Study the properties of stem cells, such as self-renewal and differentiation potential, and identify markers for specific cell types.

- **Drug Discovery and Development** ðŸ’Š: Identify new drug targets, understand drug resistance mechanisms, and optimize drug development pipelines.

  abstract  = "The application of multiple omics technologies in biomedical
               cohorts has the potential to reveal patient-level disease
               characteristics and individualized response to treatment.
               However, the scale and heterogeneous nature of multi-modal data
               makes integration and inference a non-trivial task. We developed
               a deep-learning-based framework, multi-omics variational
               autoencoders (MOVE), to integrate such data and applied it to a
               cohort of 789 people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with
               deep multi-omics phenotyping from the DIRECT consortium. Using
               in silico perturbations, we identified drug-omics associations
               across the multi-modal datasets for the 20 most prevalent drugs
               given to people with type 2 diabetes with substantially higher
               sensitivity than univariate statistical tests. From these, we
               among others, identified novel associations between metformin
               and the gut microbiota as well as opposite molecular responses
               for the two statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin. We used the
               associations to quantify drug-drug similarities, assess the
               degree of polypharmacy and conclude that drug effects are
               distributed across the multi-omics modalities.",
